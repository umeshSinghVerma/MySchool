# Welcome to My School üè´

 

At My School, we're passionate about providing students with an online learning experience tailored to their needs. Our platform employs cutting-edge technology to ensure every student stays engaged and gets the most out of their education.

## Our Approach

### Personalized Learning Experience

We understand that every student learns differently. That's why we use **real-time eye movement monitoring** during online classes to gauge attentiveness. Whether it's a video lecture or reading materials, we track how students interact with the content.

### Tailored Support

Based on this attentiveness data, we offer personalized support to enhance learning:

- **Interactive Quizzes:** If a student already knows the content of a video lecture, they might not pay full attention. To tackle this, we quiz them after each session. These quizzes, created by AI or the instructor, help gauge their understanding. If they score below 50%, we suggest they revisit the lecture from where they lost focus. This tailored approach ensures students grasp key concepts effectively.

- **Customized Courses:** \
  With this data, we craft personalized courses for students. These courses include comprehensive notes, quizzes, and video references tailored to areas where the student lacked attention. By focusing on crucial topics and addressing their individual learning needs, we ensure students are well-prepared for exams and can achieve excellent results.

- **Teacher Support:** We also evaluate teacher performance based on student feedback. If a significant portion of students express boredom or disengagement, it indicates a need for the teacher to reassess and potentially improve their teaching methods. This feedback loop ensures that instructors continually refine their approach to better engage and educate students effectively.

## Key Features

### Multi-Platform Compatibility

During the login process, our system conducts eye calibration to detect the edges of your device, enabling it to identify the device you are using. This ensures seamless functionality across various devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and large monitors

### Student-Centric Calendars

Utilizing AI or instructor input, our system creates a personalized daily calendar for each student. This calendar outlines all the tasks that need to be completed by the end of the day, ensuring students stay organized and on track with their studies.

### Seamless Integration

In our daily calendar feature, teachers have the flexibility to conduct online classes on various platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and more. They can also provide video references from platforms like YouTube or recorded lectures. Our system seamlessly collects attentiveness data from all these different platforms, providing independence external to the app while ensuring comprehensive monitoring of student engagement.

### Real-Time Feedback

Our system continuously monitors students' eyes and alerts them if their faces are not detected in the camera's field of view. Additionally, if teachers utilize our dedicated video conferencing tool, they receive notifications when the attention level of 50% of the class is low. This proactive approach ensures that both students and teachers stay engaged and attentive during online classes
